- 👋 Hi, I’m Bogdan Fometescu a.k.a @Boschetzel
- 👀 I’m  a self taught programmer, still on the learning path to be precise. I am really interested in OOP/DataScience and Automation concepts and I try to implement the things I learn into projects as I found out this is the best way to learn programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python language with some widely used frameworks and lib.Still, a lot more to learn but I am confident the results will be great if I keept the current learning schedule.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any  Python OpenSource Projects or I can do free coding or helping anyone as this is a win-win situation for both parts : I learn, You get work done.
- 📫 How to reach me - you can mail me at:  look on my PandasDataFrame projects setup.py  :) contact info are there.
